This folder will contain the latest stable version of CocoIDE. 
Make sure that you have Python installed (V3+ preferred, but should work ok with Python 2.7). Visit www.python.org and follow the insttalation instructions for your OS (Linux, MAC/OSX OR Windows). When installing Python, make sure the install py.exe (Python) launcheroption is enabled. Also to run CocoIDE from a terminal or command line interface, Select the "Modify Environment Variables" option.

Then download and extract the CocoIDE.pyzw file to a folder on your local hard drive. From your File manager simply Double click to run. 

Troubleshooting:

You may have to configure your File Manager, File Explorer, Finder program to open the CocoIDE.pyzw with python or pythonw. Right click and select "Opn with" and choose python or pythonw, and make this the defaulyt action for thid file type.

MAC/OSX: In later versions of OSX, folder that are linked to the cloud have securuty permissions set that will not allow Python programs to run. To avoid this make sure oyu save the CocoIDE download to a new folder created directly in your home directory or folder, that ois not linked to any cloud services. If the CocoIDE.pyzw file still does not run correctly, you may find that using the uncompressed source code version will run ok. Simply download the Source version and extract to a new local folder.
